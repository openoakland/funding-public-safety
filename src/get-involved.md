There are plenty of ways you can make an impact on violence prevention and public safety in Oakland.

## Attend a public meeting

The City of Oakland has a number of public commissions that evaluate city efforts and make recommendations on city spending. You can often attend these meetings as a member of the public and submit your own comments. Many of these commissions also have openings for Oakland residents who would like to serve as volunteer commissioners.

- The [Public Safety Services and Violence Prevention Commission](https://www.oaklandca.gov/boards-commissions/public-safety-and-services-violence-prevention-oversight-commission) (SSOC) oversees Measure Z funding.
- The [Oakland Police Commission](https://www.oaklandca.gov/boards-commissions/police-commission) has several ad hoc committees:

  - [Missing Persons Policy Ad Hoc Committee](https://www.oaklandca.gov/resources/missing-persons-policy-ad-hoc-commitee)
  - [Inspector General Search Ad Hoc Committee](https://www.oaklandca.gov/topics/inspector-general-search-ad-hoc-committee)
  - [Community Policing Ad Hoc Committee](https://www.oaklandca.gov/topics/community-policing-ad-hoc-committee)
  - [Internal Affairs Policy and Procedure Ad Hoc Committee](https://www.oaklandca.gov/resources/internal-affairs-division-investigative-procedures-manual-policy-ad-hoc)
  - [Armed and Unresponsive Persons and Arrest Teams Ad Hoc Committee](https://www.oaklandca.gov/topics/armed-and-unresponsive-persons-and-arrest-teams-hoc-committee)
  - [Militarized Equipment Ad Hoc Committee](https://www.oaklandca.gov/resources/ad-hoc-committee-on-militarized-equipment)

## Organizations working on public safety

The following nonprofit organizations work on public safety and policing issues in Oakland:

- The [Coalition for Police Accountability](https://www.coalitionforpoliceaccountability.com/about) advocates for accountability of the Oakland Police Department to the community so that the Oakland Police Department operates with equitable, just, constitutional, transparent policies and practices that reflect the values and engender the trust of the community.
- The [Anti Police-Terror Project](https://www.antipoliceterrorproject.org/) is a Black-led, multi-racial, intergenerational coalition that seeks to build a replicable and sustainable model to eradicate police terror in communities of color.
- [Oakland Rising](https://www.oaklandrising.org/) is a multilingual, multiracial collaborative that educates and mobilizes voters in the flatlands to speak up for and take charge of the issues impacting their lives, shifting misguided conceptions of public safety from one of fear to one of abundance.
