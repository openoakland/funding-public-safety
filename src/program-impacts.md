Measure Z aims to achieve the following goals:

- Reduce homicides, robberies, burglaries, and gun-related violence.
- Improve police and fire emergency 911 response times and other police services.
- Support at-risk youth and young adults.

The law identifies a number of strategies to reach those outcomes and funds programming accordingly.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<p><b>Current questions we're exploring:</b>

- Are these strategies appropriate for Oakland and those most impacted by violence?
- What are the strategies based on?
- How were they developed?
- Does the city collect and release appropriate data so the Oversight Commission, program evaluators and public understand program impacts?
- What evidence exists that these strategies work?</p>

## Existing data about Measure Z outcomes

Measure Z allocates 3% of funding to evaluation, so a good deal of data exists exploring the measure's impact to date. Much of it is summarized in annual evaluation reports provided by two third-party evaluation teams contracted by the City of Oakland:

- OPD policing evaluations have been conducted by [Resource Development Associates](https://rdaconsulting.com/).
- Dept. of Violence Prevention program evaluations have been conducted by [Mathematica](https://www.mathematica.org/).

City agencies record certain data throughout the year and make some of it accessible to evaluators. Both evaluation firms combine this agency data with additional quantitative and qualitative data, such as interviews, to inform their reports.

How to collect and report on potentially sensitive or personal data from program participants remains an ongoing challenge for program administrators.

### The evaluation reports

The City has published [11 key annual reports](https://www.oaklandca.gov/documents/measure-z-reports-and-evaluation-data) to date. A lot of additional material is buried in [dozens of PDFs](https://www.oaklandca.gov/boards-commissions/public-safety-and-services-violence-prevention-oversight-commission/meetings) reflecting information presented at the Oversight Commission's monthly meetings. Our team is working to extract the data available in these files, so we can make it more accessible, searchable and understandable. If you'd like to help with this work, please [get in touch](https://bit.ly/fps-interest).
