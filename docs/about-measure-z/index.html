      <p>Measure Z is an attempt to improve public safety in Oakland by reducing violent crime and improving emergency services.</p>
<h2>Measure Z's goals</h2>
<p>In 2014, 74% of Oakland voters approved ballot measure Z. Measure Z collects and distributes money to programs serving three goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce homicides, robberies, burglaries, and gun-related violence</li>
<li>Improve police and fire emergency 911 response times and other police services</li>
<li>Support at-risk youth and young adults</li>
</ol>
<h2>Methods for achieving these goals</h2>
<p>There are three main ways Measure Z attempts to achieve these goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Staff community-centered policing roles and projects.</strong> There are 35 police beats in Oakland, grouped into five policing areas. Each area is assigned a Community Resource Team (CRT) of eight officers: one Community Resource Officer (CRO) for each beat in the area, plus a designated CRO to coordinate projects.</li>
<li><strong>Invest in violence intervention and prevention strategies</strong> that provide support for at-risk youth and young adults to interrupt the cycle of violence and recidivism. Currently, 26 different programs are funded through the Dept. of Violence Prevention.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain an oversight commission</strong> appointed by the Mayor and City Council to “review and evaluate” the measure's implementation.</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<b>One controversial component of Measure Z is its requirement that the City budget for and staff at least 678 police officers.</b> The measure specifically prohibits the city from laying off any officers if it would bring OPD under this minimum. If the City fails to do this, the amount of money collected to fund these programs is reduced based on how long the police staff size remains under the minimum. If it fails to budget for this minimum at all, no money at all may be collected. There are some exceptions to this.
</div>
<h2>How Measure Z distributes money</h2>
<p>Measure Z funds are distributed in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>3% to audit and evaluate the programs funded by the measure, including management of the Oversight Commission</li>
<li>$2 million to the Oakland Fire Department</li>
<li>60% of the remaining funds to the Oakland Police Department for the staffing of specific roles and programs</li>
<li>40% of the remaining funds to be spent on community-focused violence prevention and intervention services and strategies</li>
</ul>
<h3>How much money is spent</h3>
<p><em>[placeholder for dataviz]</em></p>
<h3>Where the money comes from</h3>
<p>Measure Z collects money through two taxes: a parcel tax and a parking tax. Oakland property owners pay between $51.09 and $99.77 depending on the type of parcel or property they own:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-family residential: $99.77 per unit</li>
<li>Multiple-family residential: $68.15 per unit</li>
<li>Non-residential: $51.09 per unit</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, parking lot operators are charged an 8.5% tax on the rental of each parking space. Both of these taxes existed prior to Measure Z; the measure simply continued these taxes and further defined the use of the money.</p>
<h2>Editorial coverage</h2>
<p>Public safety has increasingly been covered in local and national news. Coverage specifically about Measure Z is less frequent.</p>
